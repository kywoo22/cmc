currencies.whatIsBitcoin = What is Bitcoin (BTC)?
currencies.bitcoinDescription = Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was first introduced in a white paper in 2008, authored by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched in January 2009.<br> <br>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning all transactions occur directly between equal, independent network participants without the need for a central authority. According to Nakamoto, Bitcoin was created to allow \u201conline payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\u201d<br> <br>While similar concepts of decentralized electronic money existed prior to BTC, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be successfully implemented and widely adopted.<br>
currencies.faq1.q = Who is the founder of Bitcoin?
currencies.faq1.a = The original inventor of Bitcoin is known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2020, the true identity behind this name\u2014whether an individual or a group\u2014remains unknown.<br> <br>On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper, detailing how a peer-to-peer digital currency could work. It proposed a decentralized ledger\u2014packaged in groups called \u201cblocks\u201d and secured via cryptographic algorithms. This entire system later became known as the \u201cblockchain.\u201d<br> <br>On January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network\u2014referred to as the genesis block\u2014thus launching the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.<br> <br>Though Nakamoto is the original creator and initiator, over the years many developers have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency software by fixing vulnerabilities and adding new features.<br> <br>The Bitcoin source code repository on GitHub lists over 750 contributors, including Vladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, and Jonas Schnelli.
currencies.faq2.q = What makes Bitcoin special?
currencies.faq2.a = Bitcoin's uniqueness stems from being the first cryptocurrency to emerge in the market.<br> <br>It kickstarted a global community and a new industry composed of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade, and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in daily life. This first cryptocurrency laid the conceptual and technical foundation for thousands of competing projects.<br> <br>Today\u2019s cryptocurrency market, worth over $300 billion, is based on Bitcoin\u2019s revolutionary idea that money can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world, without relying on trusted intermediaries like banks or financial services.<br> <br>Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC has remained at the top of this vibrant market for over a decade. Even after losing undisputed dominance, Bitcoin is still the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. As of 2020, its market cap ranged between $100 billion and $200 billion, bolstered by its wide range of use cases such as wallets, exchanges, payment services, and online games.
currencies.faq3.q = How many Bitcoins are in circulation?
currencies.faq3.a = Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is capped by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created through a process known as \u201cmining.\u201d When transactions are relayed through the network, miners select and package them into blocks, which are then secured by complex cryptographic calculations.<br> <br>As compensation for their computing effort, miners receive rewards for successfully adding blocks to the blockchain. At Bitcoin\u2019s launch, the reward was 50 BTC per block. This reward is halved roughly every 210,000 blocks\u2014about every four years. As of 2020, the reward had reduced to 6.25 BTC per block.<br> <br>Bitcoin is not pre-mined, meaning no coins were mined or distributed before it was publicly released. However, in its early years, mining competition was low, allowing early adopters to accumulate significant amounts through regular mining. Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own around one million BTC.
currencies.faq4.q = How is the Bitcoin network secured?
currencies.faq4.a = Bitcoin is secured using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which belongs to the SHA-2 family. This algorithm is also used by its fork, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and various other cryptocurrencies.
currencies.faq5.q = Where can I buy Bitcoin (BTC)?
currencies.faq5.a = Bitcoin is practically synonymous with cryptocurrency and can be bought with fiat currency or other cryptos on virtually all exchanges. Some of the major markets for BTC include:<br> <br>Binance, Coinbase Pro, OKEx, Kraken, Huobi Global, Bitfinex.<br> <br>If you're new to crypto, try using CoinExpress's simple guides to get started with buying Bitcoin.
currencies.faq6.q = What is a Bitcoin address?
currencies.faq6.a = Just like email addresses ensure messages are delivered to the right person, a Bitcoin address ensures crypto is sent securely.<br><br>A public key allows you to send and receive BTC. It\u2019s often provided in the form of a QR code.<br><br>Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a PhD in computer science to use the Bitcoin network\u2014most exchanges and wallets will generate an address for you when you buy BTC.
currencies.faq7.q = How are Bitcoin addresses generated?
currencies.faq7.a = Bitcoin addresses can seem intimidating due to their length\u2014typically 25 to 36 characters made of letters and numbers. They start with \u201c1,\u201d \u201c3,\u201d or \u201cbc1.\u201d<br><br>Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, similar to wire transfers. Always double- or triple-check the address format before sending.<br><br>If BTC is sent to the wrong crypto wallet, recovering it can be extremely difficult, as the owner of the receiving wallet must voluntarily send it back.
currencies.faq8.q = How are Bitcoin addresses stored?
currencies.faq8.a = Keeping your private and public keys secure is crucial. Here are a few methods:<br><br><strong>Crypto Exchanges</strong>: Platforms like Coinbase and Binance provide a familiar experience, similar to logging into PayPal or online banking. Their mobile wallets are available on Android and iOS and offer full transaction histories. Using passphrases and two-factor authentication helps keep accounts secure.<br><br><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong>: Unlike hot wallets, which are internet-connected and vulnerable, hardware wallets store encrypted coins offline on physical devices, making them more secure. Many also support ETH and other cryptos.<br><br><strong>Paper Wallets</strong>: A truly old-school method\u2014printing or writing down your Bitcoin address on paper. However, if you lose your paper wallet, your BTC is gone forever.
currencies.faq9.q = What is the mempool?
currencies.faq9.a = While learning how Bitcoin transactions work, you may encounter the term \u201cmempool,\u201d short for memory pool.<br><br>The mempool is a record of all unconfirmed BTC transactions waiting to be added to the next block in the blockchain. Each node on the network temporarily stores this data, acting like a buffer or waiting room for pending transactions.<br><br>When new blocks are added to the blockchain, the mempool is cleared periodically. Only transactions that meet a minimum fee threshold are confirmed and removed.<br><br>Lower-priority transactions (e.g., with low fees) may wait through multiple blocks before being confirmed.
currencies.faq10.q = What is Hash Rate?
currencies.faq10.a = <a href="">Hash rate</a> is a key indicator of the health of the Bitcoin blockchain. Simply put, it represents the total amount of processing power currently dedicated to the Bitcoin network.<br><br>To summarize, hash rate measures how much computational energy miners are investing to process blocks of transactions.<br><br>The higher the hash power, the more stable the blockchain. New blocks are produced every 10 minutes to ensure continued mining activity. The <a href="">mining difficulty</a> on the blockchain is adjusted approximately every two weeks. If the hash rate is high and the math problems for block rewards are too easy, new BTC would enter circulation too quickly. (Conversely, overly difficult calculations could also cause issues.)<br><br>The next section of this guide will cover the equipment needed to mine Bitcoin successfully.
currencies.faq11.q = What is a Bitcoin Mining Rig?
currencies.faq11.a = In simple terms, a mining rig is a specialized setup built to mine new Bitcoins.<br><br>These advanced processing units aim to achieve high hash rates, giving miners more chances to solve cryptographic puzzles first.<br><br>Several companies manufacture Bitcoin mining hardware, and building a rig from parts is also an option. Power costs must be carefully considered, as high electricity bills can exceed any mining profits.<br><br>A proper mining rig includes a motherboard, reliable graphics cards (NVIDIA and AMD are major suppliers), a robust power supply unit, cooling solutions to prevent overheating, a reliable processor, and a durable frame to house and protect the equipment from dust.
currencies.faq12.q = Should I Start Bitcoin Mining?
currencies.faq12.a = Unfortunately, Bitcoin mining is far from simple. It consumes a massive amount of electricity. For context, the blockchain uses 68.13 terawatt-hours annually\u2014the equivalent of what the Czech Republic (with 10.7 million people) consumes in a year. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average U.S. home does in 20 days, according to Digiconomist.<br><br>Bitcoin mining can still be profitable\u2014especially in areas with cheap electricity. Profitability depends heavily on Bitcoin\u2019s current market price. Even when BTC is worth only $4,000, mining may still be worth it due to lower difficulty and greater potential for mining rewards.
currencies.faq13.q = Are There Altcoin Mining Opportunities?
currencies.faq13.a = Yes, mining hardware can be repurposed for smaller blockchains. Note that Ethereum is phasing out its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, meaning ETH mining will soon no longer be possible.<br><br>Dogecoin, for example, uses the Scrypt algorithm and is not compatible with SHA-256 Bitcoin mining equipment. This \u201cjoke\u201d cryptocurrency is also quite difficult to mine using CPUs, often requiring ASIC investment. (Given its sub-cent price range, upside may be limited.)<br><br>Alternative coins include Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash, all of which still use proof-of-work consensus models.

currencies.faq15.a = There are many types of Bitcoin wallets\u2014web, desktop, paper\u2014so which is right for you?<br><br>Table of Contents<br> \u2022 Software Wallets<br> \u2022 Web Wallets<br> \u2022 Multisig Wallets<br> \u2022 Desktop Wallets<br> \u2022 Mobile Wallets<br> \u2022 Hardware Wallets<br> \u2022 Paper Wallets<br><br>In the previous section, we explored how Bitcoin wallets differ from traditional bank accounts used for fiat currencies.<br><br>This section explains software, hardware, and paper wallets\u2014and how to use them.<br><br>Beyond the three main types, Bitcoin wallets can use either single-key or multi-signature technology and be categorized as "hot" (internet-connected) or "cold" (offline) storage.
currencies.faq16.q = What is a Software Wallet?
currencies.faq16.a = Software wallets include web, desktop, and mobile wallets.
currencies.faq17.q = What is a Web Wallet?
currencies.faq17.a = A web wallet allows users to interact with the BTC blockchain through a browser interface while hosting private keys and other credentials on an online server. This makes web wallets a type of <a href="">hot</a> wallet.<br><br>Many web wallets are hosted by third parties like cryptocurrency exchanges, enabling users to store and trade crypto within a single interface.<br><br>When users create an account on an exchange, a BTC wallet is typically created automatically. Some exchanges also create multiple wallets for various tradable assets.<br><br>Advantages include ease of use and seamless integration with trading functions. Creating an account is similar to registering for other online services but often requires users to upload identification documents for the Know Your Customer (<a href="">KYC</a>) process.<br><br>However, since private keys are often managed by third parties, these wallets are vulnerable to scams and cyberattacks like exchange hacks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to enable all security tools offered\u2014like 2FA, withdrawal access control, and anti-phishing protections.<br><br>To address concerns about giving up key control, some web wallets have evolved into multisig wallets.
currencies.faq18.q = What is a Multisig Wallet?
currencies.faq18.a = Multisig stands for "multisignature"\u2014a type of digital signature that allows two or more users to sign a transaction.<br><br>Standard Bitcoin wallets\u2014whether web or otherwise\u2014use single-key technology, meaning one private key is required to access the funds.<br><br>In contrast, multisig wallets require multiple trusted parties to authorize transactions or access wallet holdings.<br><br>This approach mitigates single-key risks and is often used by enterprises for secure management or escrow transactions.
currencies.faq19.q = What is a Desktop Wallet?
currencies.faq19.a = Desktop wallets differ from web wallets in that they are software programs downloaded and run locally on a user\u2019s computer. These wallets give full control over private keys, typically stored in a wallet.dat file.<br><br>To ensure safety, users should protect access to this file and check for viruses or malware before installing the wallet.<br><br>Backing up the wallet.dat file or exporting corresponding keys or seed phrases is essential for future recovery if the computer malfunctions.
currencies.faq20.q = What is a Mobile Wallet?
currencies.faq20.a = Mobile wallets, as the name suggests, are operated through smartphone apps and are typically set up for easy everyday BTC transactions using QR codes. Some mobile wallets are app versions of exchange accounts and use the same login and wallet credentials.<br><br>Like web and desktop wallets, users must back up their private key or seed phrase and watch out for malicious apps or malware.
currencies.faq21.q = What is a Hardware Wallet?
currencies.faq21.a = As mentioned, convenient software wallets can be vulnerable to security risks related to online services or centralized providers.<br><br>That\u2019s why long-term holders (HODLers) often prefer hardware wallets, which are \u201ccold\u201d because they remain offline.<br><br>These physical electronic devices typically use a random number generator (RNG) to create public/private key pairs.<br><br>They often include security PIN codes and a recovery phrase\u2014usually a 24-word mnemonic seed\u2014to restore access to private keys.<br><br>Although slightly less user-friendly than software options, hardware wallets are considered the most secure method of crypto storage due to their immunity to cyberattacks and malware. Many popular models include easy-to-use desktop apps.<br><br>Some hardware wallets can also connect to decentralized exchanges or web wallets to bridge gaps in trading capabilities.
currencies.faq22.q = What is a Paper Wallet?
currencies.faq22.a = A paper wallet is another form of cold storage\u2014a physical piece of paper that displays your Bitcoin address and corresponding private key, typically as QR codes.<br><br>While safer than hot wallets in terms of cyber threats, they come with drawbacks: they must be stored physically, can be clunky, and usually don\u2019t support partial spending.<br><br>To use part of a paper wallet\u2019s balance, you must transfer the full amount to another wallet (web, desktop, or hardware) and then send part of it from there.<br><br>If you only transfer a portion of the balance, you risk the remainder being sent to a change address\u2014meaning it\u2019s no longer on the original paper wallet. Failing to configure this properly can result in a loss of funds.
currencies.faq23.q = How to Generate a Bitcoin Address?
currencies.faq23.a = Just like email addresses help ensure messages reach the right person, Bitcoin addresses help ensure secure crypto transfers.<br><br>Table of Contents:<br> \u2022 What is a Bitcoin address?<br> \u2022 How is it generated?<br> \u2022 How to store a Bitcoin address?<br> \u2022 Quick tips to keep your crypto safe<br><br>You\u2019ve decided to buy Bitcoin\u2014but wait! What\u2019s all the fuss about? Do you need a private key? Where does a Bitcoin wallet come in? Here's our ultimate (and simple) guide to creating a crypto address.
currencies.faq24.q = Quick Tips to Keep Your Crypto Safe
currencies.faq24.a = You wouldn\u2019t keep $50,000 in your wallet\u2014so why treat your BTC any differently?<br><br>Using more than one Bitcoin address can be a wise move to spread out your holdings.<br><br>Mobile wallets are great for carrying small amounts during outings or purchases. For long-term storage, a high-end hardware wallet is best. Here\u2019s a short guide for keeping your crypto secure. For full details, click here!
currencies.faq25.q = How to Send Bitcoin
currencies.faq25.a = Now that you've bought and sold Bitcoin, it\u2019s time to learn how to send it.<br><br>Table of Contents:<br> \u2022 Bitcoin Wallet<br> \u2022 Sending Bitcoin: Key Pointers<br> \u2022 What is the Mempool?<br><br>Bitcoin (BTC) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that enables direct transactions without intermediaries. To send BTC, you need to be familiar with the basic infrastructure of Bitcoin transactions.
currencies.faq26.q = What is a Bitcoin Wallet?
currencies.faq26.a = To send Bitcoin (BTC), users need a Bitcoin wallet, which acts as a tool to interact with the blockchain.<br><br>While it's common to say a wallet \u201cstores\u201d your crypto, it's more accurate to say that it generates the information necessary to send and receive crypto via blockchain transactions.<br><br>There are three basic types of Bitcoin wallets: software, hardware, and paper. Each varies in functionality and security. Wallets are also categorized as either \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d depending on internet connectivity.<br><br>Users may send BTC as payments to others or transfer it between their own wallets for various purposes such as trading or long-term holding (HODLing).<br><br>Any wallet can be used to send Bitcoin to another address\u2014as long as it\u2019s a Bitcoin-specific address and not one for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or XRP.
currencies.faq27.q = Sending Bitcoin: Key Pointers
currencies.faq27.a = The exact process of sending BTC depends on the wallet type and provider you choose.<br><br>In all cases, you'll use a provided interface\u2014mobile app, desktop application, web browser, or Bitcoin ATM\u2014to specify how much BTC you want to send.<br><br>You\u2019ll also need access to the recipient\u2019s wallet address to complete the transfer.<br><br>A single user can generate multiple new wallet addresses using their Bitcoin wallet, each paired with a unique private key. The private key must remain confidential, while the public address is visible on the blockchain.<br><br>To simplify things, some software and paper wallet providers allow QR code scanning to access the recipient\u2019s address.<br><br>Some providers even allow you to send BTC using an email address linked to the recipient\u2019s wallet.<br><br>If QR or email aren\u2019t supported, carefully check the alphanumeric characters of the address\u2014just like double-checking a bank account number.<br><br>Transferring between software wallets hosted by the same exchange (e.g., Coinbase and Coinbase Pro) may use deposit/receive functions rather than a formal \u201csend.\u201d<br><br>To send BTC from a hardware wallet\u2014such as Ledger Nano S\u2014you typically need a companion desktop app to interface with the device.<br><br>One key factor to keep in mind is the transaction fee: choosing a lower fee may delay confirmation of your transaction on the blockchain.
currencies.faq28.q = So What Can You Do with Bitcoin Now?
currencies.faq28.a = While home mining may no longer be viable, there are still ways to participate in crypto mining without going broke.<br><br>Table of Contents:<br> \u2022 How transactions work on the Bitcoin network<br> \u2022 What is hash rate?<br> \u2022 What is a mining rig?<br> \u2022 Main types of mining rigs<br> \u2022 Alternatives: mining pools and cloud mining<br> \u2022 Should you start mining Bitcoin?<br> \u2022 Are there altcoin mining opportunities?<br><br>Mining BTC has become much harder over the years. In the early days, anyone with a laptop could solve math problems to confirm blocks and earn 50 BTC (which may have been worth only a few bucks back then).<br><br>Today, it's far less accessible. Block rewards halve every few years, bringing the current reward to just 6.25 BTC per block. Yet transactions still need validation, so transaction fees now play a crucial role.<br><br>This section explains how Bitcoin mining works, what kind of computing power is needed to run the blockchain, and how mining hardware can be used in other proof-of-work systems.
currencies.faq29.q = How Are Transactions Performed on the Bitcoin Network?
currencies.faq29.a = Before diving into how new Bitcoin is created, here\u2019s a simple look at how blocks are mined.<br><br>As you (hopefully) know, the blockchain is a public record of every Bitcoin transaction since the first block was mined in 2009. It\u2019s been designed to be tamper-resistant\u2014altering data would require recalculating all subsequent blocks, which demands enormous computing power.<br><br>One major benefit of a public ledger is its ability to prevent double-spending\u2014ensuring the same BTC isn\u2019t spent twice. With physical money, you can\u2019t use the same bill to buy shoes and a video game at the same time.<br><br>Back to mining: a new block is created roughly every 10 minutes. This means Bitcoin miners are constantly competing to win block rewards.<br><br>Mining requires substantial processing power. The lucky miner who solves the math puzzle first gets to validate the block\u2014this difficulty deters denial-of-service attacks and underpins the proof-of-work system.<br><br>Each new block is 1MB and is filled with pending transactions from the mempool. Miners prioritize those offering higher fees.<br><br>The block also includes a special \u201ccoinbase transaction\u201d that rewards the miner with 6.25 BTC and all transaction fees in that block.<br><br>That\u2019s a lot in 10 minutes! Now that you have a basic idea of how BTC mining works, grab a coffee and dive deeper into the next section.
currencies.faq30.q = Main Types of Mining Rigs
currencies.faq30.a = Let\u2019s explore some of the most common mining setups. Each Bitcoin mining hardware type has its pros and cons:<br>\u2022 ASIC Mining \u2013 Application-Specific Integrated Circuits built solely for mining Bitcoin and other cryptos. These vary in price and form but are powerful and energy-efficient.<br>\u2022 Scrypt Mining \u2013 This method is popular for coins like Litecoin and improves upon SHA-256 hashing. It stores random numbers in RAM, making it more accessible for GPU users and less effective for ASICs.<br>\u2022 GPU Mining \u2013 The most popular method among mining farms, using graphic cards to process blockchain data. It\u2019s effective but expensive and prone to rapid obsolescence, requiring high cooling and maintenance costs.<br>\u2022 CPU Mining \u2013 A basic, low-cost method using just a computer. It\u2019s inefficient for BTC but suitable for some altcoins. Some software even mines in the background using idle processing power.<br><br>Alternatives:<br><br>\u2022 Mining Pools \u2013 Groups of miners combine computing power to improve block reward chances, with profits shared among participants.<br>\u2022 Cloud Mining \u2013 Users rent processing power without owning hardware. Be cautious: fees and contracts can eat into profits.

currencies.level.beginner = Beginner
currencies.level.intermediate = Intermediate
currencies.level.expert = Expert
currencies.compare = Compare With
currencies.whitepaper01.q = Overview
currencies.whitepaper01.a = Bitcoin is an innovative digital payment system that allows people to send money directly to one another without the need for banks or intermediaries. You can think of it as digital cash that works over the internet but includes special security features to prevent copying or double-spending. Bitcoin solves the problem of recording transactions in a reliable and decentralized way. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has grown into a global financial phenomenon adopted by millions of users and major institutions.
currencies.whitepaper02.q = Technology
currencies.whitepaper02.a = Imagine a massive digital ledger that everyone can see but no single person controls. That\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.<br>When someone sends Bitcoin, the transaction is broadcast to a global network of computers.<br>These computers, called "miners," verify the transactions and group them into pages of the ledger called "blocks."<br>To make sure everyone agrees on which transactions happened when, Bitcoin uses something called "proof of work."<br>Think of it like a very hard math puzzle that computers must solve.<br>The first computer to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block to the chain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin.<br>This system makes it extremely difficult to cheat or alter past transactions, since you\u2019d have to redo all the puzzles and convince everyone else of your version.<br>One of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin's design is that it doesn\u2019t require trust in any person or organization.<br>Instead, it relies on math and cryptography, and the system rewards participants for following the rules rather than cheating.
currencies.whitepaper03.q = Tokenomics
currencies.whitepaper03.a = Bitcoin\u2019s economic system is designed to mimic digital gold.<br>Just as the amount of gold in the world is limited, only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist.<br>New Bitcoins are created through mining: when computers solve complex puzzles to verify transactions, they\u2019re rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.<br>This reward started at 50 BTC per block and is cut in half about every four years through a process called \u201chalving.\u201d<br>Currently, miners receive 3.125 BTC per block, and the next halving, scheduled for 2028, will reduce it to 1.5625 BTC.<br>This gradual reduction in supply makes Bitcoin naturally resistant to inflation, unlike traditional currencies which governments can print at will.<br>Users can include small transaction fees when sending Bitcoin, which incentivizes miners to continue processing transactions as block rewards decline over time.<br>As of early 2025, around 20 million Bitcoins have already been mined, and the last Bitcoin is expected to be mined around the year 2140.
currencies.whitepaper04.q = Roadmap
currencies.whitepaper04.a = Bitcoin\u2019s development follows a cautious and conservative approach focused on security and stability. Unlike many other crypto projects, Bitcoin has no official roadmap or central development team. Instead, improvements are proposed, discussed, and implemented by the community. Major updates are adopted through broad consensus among users, miners, and developers. Current development efforts aim to improve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability through solutions like the Lightning Network, and to enhance privacy and security features. A recent key upgrade, Taproot, introduced in 2021, enhances both privacy and smart contract functionality. The community also continues to explore Layer 2 solutions and sidechains to expand Bitcoin\u2019s utility while preserving its core principles of security and decentralization.
currencies.whitepaper05.q = Team
currencies.whitepaper05.a = Bitcoin was created by someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who published the whitepaper in 2008 and launched the network in 2009.<br>Satoshi\u2019s true identity remains unknown, and he stepped away from the project in 2010.<br>Today, Bitcoin is maintained by a global developer community working to improve its open-source code.<br>No individual or organization controls Bitcoin. Its development and operations are fully decentralized, making it difficult for any single entity to manipulate or control it.<br>Since Bitcoin\u2019s inception, its developer community has grown significantly, with contributors working on everything from core development to Layer 2 solutions.
